# CarND-Advanced-Lane-Finding

## Overview

•	Camera calibration matrix and distortion coefficients

•	Distortion correction

•	Use color transforms, gradients, etc., to create a thresholded binary image

•	Apply a perspective transform to rectify binary image ("birds-eye view").

•	Detect lane pixels and fit to find the lane boundary.

•	Determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.

•	Warp the detected lane boundaries back onto the original image.

•	Output visual display of the lane boundaries and numerical estimation of lane curvature and vehicle position.

## Motivation

Detect the lane lines and determine the curvature of the lane and vehicle position with respect to center.  This is a sub-module to the self-driving car challenge to find
